        ML Introduction
      </h1>

      <p className="mb-6 text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed">
        Machine Learning (ML) is a field of computer science that gives machines the ability to learn from data and experiences—much like humans do—and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform those tasks.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-8 text-base sm:text-lg md:text-xl leading-relaxed">
        Instead of following strict instructions coded by a developer, ML algorithms are trained using data, and from this data, they learn patterns, trends, and relationships to solve problems or automate processes.
